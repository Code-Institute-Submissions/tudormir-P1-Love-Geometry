I am Mirela Tudor and this is my project Geometry then and now.
My idea was to create a website abou the history of Geometry. All the text and pictures that I used to create the six additional pages are from Wikipedia. Wikipedia is a free website, so I hope I didn't commit plagiarism. The webpages that I used from Wikipedia are the following:
From https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geometry I took the text and the math related pictures. The webpages from the footer are the following:
- https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_formulas_in_elementary_geometry
- https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_geometry_topics
- https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lists_of_mathematics_topics
The main image is from a Canadian website https://theculturetrip.com/north-america/canada/articles/canadian-artist-paints-famous-landscapes-with-geometric-patterns/ and the picture is called ‘Vermillion Lakes’, acrylic painting | © and courtesy of Elyse Dodge. The website have a copy-right policy. 

I have started by folowing the video about Love Running and bulding my own website.
In the begining I have used the code for the header on the main page from the Love Running video.
When I started adding the main image I have begon changing the code. My first probleem starting with the image. The image didn't show because the file of the image was not in the images directory.
Another change was to have only two links in the header: Home and contact. Because I was using another six pages I tought I do not need the gallery. Instead I have six images added to the six secondary pages. 
I have seen dat the property inherit wil apply the same colour to all the links, so I have use this property too, throughout the whole code.
I stil not have added the code for small displays als phone's and ipad's. I have seen it how it is done during the video from Love Running, but I have not created one for my website.
I have added the images not with an id but with <img> command. It was easier for me.
I have not used the links to facebook or other media sites, instead I have used sites from Wikipedia about Geometry.

               <h3>Geometry in Greece</h3>
                In the 7th century BC, the Greek mathematician Thales of Miletus used geometry to solve problems 
                such as calculating the height of pyramids and the distance of ships from the shore. He is credited with 
                the first use of deductive reasoning applied to geometry, by deriving four corollaries to Thales' theorem.
                Pythagoras established the Pythagorean School, which is credited with the first proof of the Pythagorean 
                theorem, though the statement of the theorem has a long history. Around 300 BC, geometry was revolutionized by 
                Euclid, whose Elements, widely considered the most successful and influential textbook of all time, 
                introduced mathematical rigor through the axiomatic method and is the earliest example of the format still 
                used in mathematics today, that of definition, axiom, theorem, and proof. Although most of the contents of 
                the Elements were already known, Euclid arranged them into a single, coherent logical framework. 
                The Elements was known to all educated people in the West until the middle of the 20th century and 
                its contents are still taught in geometry classes today.</article>

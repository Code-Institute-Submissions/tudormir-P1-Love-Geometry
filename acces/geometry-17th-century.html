             <h3>Geometry in the 17th century.</h3>
             <article>
                In the early 17th century, there were two important developments in geometry. The first was the 
                creation of analytic geometry, or geometry with coordinates and equations, by René Descartes (1596–1650)
                and Pierre de Fermat (1601–1665). This was a necessary precursor to the development of calculus and a 
                precise quantitative science of physics. The second geometric development of this period was the 
                systematic study of projective geometry by Girard Desargues (1591–1661). 
                Projective geometry studies properties of shapes which are unchanged under projections and sections, 
                especially as they relate to artistic perspective.</article>

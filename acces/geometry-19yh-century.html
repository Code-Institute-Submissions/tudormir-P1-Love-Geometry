             <h3>Geometry in the 19th century.</h3>
             <article>
                Two developments in geometry in the 19th century changed the way it had been studied previously.
                 These were the discovery of non-Euclidean geometries by Nikolai Ivanovich Lobachevsky, János 
                 Bolyai and Carl Friedrich Gauss and of the formulation of symmetry as the central consideration 
                 in the Erlangen Programme of Felix Klein (which generalized the Euclidean and non-Euclidean 
                 geometries). Two of the master geometers of the time were Bernhard Riemann (1826–1866), working 
                 primarily with tools from mathematical analysis, and introducing the Riemann surface, and Henri 
                 Poincaré, the founder of algebraic topology and the geometric theory of dynamical systems. 
                 As a consequence of these major changes in the conception of geometry, the concept of "space" 
                 became something rich and varied, and the natural background for theories as different as complex 
                 analysis and classical mechanics.</article>

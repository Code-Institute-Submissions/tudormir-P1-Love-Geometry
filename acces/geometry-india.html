             <h3>Geometry in India</h3>
             <article>
                "Indian mathematicians also made many important contributions in geometry. The Satapatha Brahmana 
                (3rd century BC) contains rules for ritual geometric constructions that are similar to the Sulba 
                Sutras. According to (Hayashi 2005, p. 363), the Śulba Sūtras contain "the earliest extant verbal 
                expression of the Pythagorean Theorem in the world, although it had already been known to the Old 
                Babylonians. They contain lists of Pythagorean triples. In the Bakhshali manuscript, there is a 
                handful of geometric problems (including problems about volumes of irregular solids). The Bakhshali 
                manuscript also "employs a decimal place value system with a dot for zero." 
                Aryabhata's Aryabhatiya includes the computation of areas and volumes. Brahmagupta wrote his 
                astronomical work Brāhma Sphuṭa Siddhānta in 628. Chapter 12, containing 66 Sanskrit verses, was 
                divided into two sections: "basic operations" (including cube roots, fractions, ratio and proportion,
                 and barter) and "practical mathematics" (including mixture, mathematical series, plane figures, 
                 stacking bricks, sawing of timber, and piling of grain). In the latter section, he stated his famous 
                 theorem on the diagonals of a cyclic quadrilateral. Chapter 12 also included a formula for the area 
                 of a cyclic quadrilateral (a generalization of Heron's formula), as well as a complete description of 
                 rational triangles (i.e. triangles with rational sides and rational areas)."</article>

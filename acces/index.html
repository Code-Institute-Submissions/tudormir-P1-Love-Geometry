            <h3>Geometry in Mesopotamia and Egypt</h3>
            <p>
               "The earliest recorded beginnings of geometry can be traced to ancient Mesopotamia and Egypt
               in the 2nd millennium BC.Early geometry was a collection of empirically discovered principles 
                concerning lengths, angles, areas, and volumes, which were developed to meet some practical 
                need in surveying, construction, astronomy, and various crafts. 
                The earliest known texts on geometry are the Egyptian Rhind Papyrus (2000–1800 BC) and 
                Moscow Papyrus (c. 1890 BC), and the Babylonian clay tablets, such as Plimpton 322 (1900 BC). 
                For example, the Moscow Papyrus gives a formula for calculating the volume of a truncated pyramid,
               or frustum.[6] Later clay tablets (350–50 BC) demonstrate that Babylonian astronomers implemented
               trapezoid procedures for computing Jupiter's position and motion within time-velocity space."</p>

            <h3>Geometry in Greece</h3>
            <p>In the 7th century BC, the Greek mathematician Thales of Miletus used geometry to solve problems 
               such as calculating the height of pyramids and the distance of ships from the shore. He is credited with 
               the first use of deductive reasoning applied to geometry, by deriving four corollaries to Thales' theorem.
               Pythagoras established the Pythagorean School, which is credited with the first proof of the Pythagorean 
               theorem, though the statement of the theorem has a long history. Around 300 BC, geometry was revolutionized by 
               Euclid, whose Elements, widely considered the most successful and influential textbook of all time, 
               introduced mathematical rigor through the axiomatic method and is the earliest example of the format still 
               used in mathematics today, that of definition, axiom, theorem, and proof. Although most of the contents of 
               the Elements were already known, Euclid arranged them into a single, coherent logical framework. 
               The Elements was known to all educated people in the West until the middle of the 20th century and 
               its contents are still taught in geometry classes today.</p>

            <h3>Geometry in India</h3>
            <p>Indian mathematicians also made many important contributions in geometry. The Satapatha Brahmana 
               (3rd century BC) contains rules for ritual geometric constructions that are similar to the Sulba 
               Sutras. According to (Hayashi 2005, p. 363), the Śulba Sūtras contain "the earliest extant verbal 
               expression of the Pythagorean Theorem in the world, although it had already been known to the Old 
               Babylonians. They contain lists of Pythagorean triples. In the Bakhshali manuscript, there is a 
               handful of geometric problems (including problems about volumes of irregular solids). The Bakhshali 
               manuscript also "employs a decimal place value system with a dot for zero." 
               Aryabhata's Aryabhatiya includes the computation of areas and volumes. Brahmagupta wrote his 
               astronomical work Brāhma Sphuṭa Siddhānta in 628. Chapter 12, containing 66 Sanskrit verses, was 
               divided into two sections: "basic operations" (including cube roots, fractions, ratio and proportion,
                and barter) and "practical mathematics" (including mixture, mathematical series, plane figures, 
                stacking bricks, sawing of timber, and piling of grain). In the latter section, he stated his famous 
                theorem on the diagonals of a cyclic quadrilateral. Chapter 12 also included a formula for the area 
                of a cyclic quadrilateral (a generalization of Heron's formula), as well as a complete description of 
                rational triangles (i.e. triangles with rational sides and rational areas).</p>
